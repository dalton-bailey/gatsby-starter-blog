<h1>Workout Tracker</h1>

I finished the ranking system and added a filter that filters by rank and sport. I started working on the design. Looking a differnet ideas and figuring out how I want the app to look.

Next week I will finish the design and add some finsihing touches to the app.

Biggest problem I ran into this week was just trying to figure out how to design the app. Styling inputs, dropdowns and checkmarks is still new to me so learning how to do that was fun.
