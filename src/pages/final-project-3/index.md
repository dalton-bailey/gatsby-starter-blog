<h1>Workout Tracker</h1>

This week I finished working on the goals and goals content and the edit and save workouts is almost working. 

Next week I plan on finishing the edit and save and adding that functionality to the gaols aswell. 

Right now the toggle to edit and save is only working on the first workout in the array I haven't quite figured out what is causing this.
