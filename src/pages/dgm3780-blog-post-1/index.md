About Me

I'm Bailey Dalton. I love skiing, hiking and Animal Crossing. I work at a small company the hosts and manages websites for mortgage companies. I've been there about a year and have designed and built the front end of a number of sites. 

I'd say most of my experience with Javascirpt was in Landon's class last semester. Seriously felt like I was drowning in Javascript, but learned some invaluable skills.

One of my favorite parts of web delevopment is working through probelms and finding the best/most effienct way to build something, but also think this is a skill that I can continuely improve upon/ hoping to learn in this class.
