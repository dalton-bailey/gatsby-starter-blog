<h1>Workout Tracker</h1>

For my final project I chose to create a workout tracker. Specifically, it will track runs, swims, and bike rides. I am training for a triatholon and thought it would be a fun project to see my progress.

This week I worked on the frontend a little bit and getting my server and database set up. I set up my server and database and had them working localy and tested them with postman. Then I used fetch to grab the workouts and post new ones. 

Next week I plan on finishing the layout of the frontend and set up the complete, delete and edit features for the workouts. 

This week felt pretty smooth. The biggest issues I ran into were spelling errors and forgetting parentheses on my functions. Nothing a second set of eyes coudln't fix. I had a coworker look over my code and he immediately caught my errors. Once fixed everything working perfectly.
