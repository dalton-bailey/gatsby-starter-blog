F.O.A

A function is a snippet of code that performs a procedure by naming the function, taking input (parameters) and returns an output.

There are a number of ways to define a function. 

function name (paramater) {
            statements
}


function myFunction(a, b) {
              return a * b
}

A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument

Example:

function returnBirthYear(year) {
               let birthYear = 2020 - -age.value()
               alert (‘Your birth year is ‘ + birthYear
}

function fromUser(callback) {
               let age = prompt(‘Please enter your age.’)
                callback(age)
}

fromUser(returnBirthYear)

Objects are a JavaScript data type. They contain and store values.

You can use a for...in loop to convert the object to an array or use the .entries() method.

Arrays are lists of objects. Two ways to loop through an array are map and forEach.
