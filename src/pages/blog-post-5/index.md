Todo App

<img src="todopic.png" alt="todoapp"/>

This is my todo app built in vanilla javascript. There are a few main features. 

1. Adding a new todo
2. Viewing the todos by all todos and other categories
3. Completing and deleting a todo
4. Toggling the completed todos

When a new todo is created it is added to the end of the list of todos. All todos can be completed by clicking the check box and deleted. The category buttons will sort and display the todos by their categories. And the Completed Todos button will show the completed todos below the active todos. 

I spent some time on Dribbble looking at todo app designs. There were some pretty cool ones out there that would have been fun to design something similar. I used some of the design aspects I found and went with a simple design. 

I'll be honest, there were a number of challenges I faced developing this app. Local storage was a big one becuase I had no previous experience with it. It took some trial and error and I eventually had a co-worker help me refactor my code so implementing local storage was a lot simpler. 

In the future, probably with any applicaiton I build, I will start with a basic html layout and design and build the app based on that. I was a bit tricky to build a feautre when I hadn't already decided how it was going to work or look like. For example, the category buttons. I thought about making them a drop down or aligning them on the left side vertically.
