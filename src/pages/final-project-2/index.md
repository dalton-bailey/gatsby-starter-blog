<h1>Workout Tracker</h1>

This week for my project I finished the delete buttons for the workouts and they work nicely now. I started working on the complete buttons. I wasn't able to get my PUT to work so I moved on to working on the distances. They now display the total distance of what the user has run, swam, and biked. I created the backend for the goals and started working on the frontend so they display correctly. 

Next week I will work on finishing the complete and edit of a workout. I also want to work on the goals and get them finished up. 

When I started working on the goals I realized they would need to save to the database. I hadn't thought this out when I originally wrote up my workouts schema and the rest of the backend. I don't know exactly what went wrong when I was connecting the frontend to the backend, I think it was some CORS issues, but it took some troubleshooting to fix it. I ended up installing a chrome extension to override CORS headers to work on my app without errors. 

On a side note, when the extension I installed is on I was unable to submit assignments in Canvas and it took me a few days and a support call to figure out. :woman_facepalming:
