Svelte

I felt like Rich Harris had a very blunt approach to discussing Svelte. You can tell he is very confident in his product and what it can do. One of the first things he mentioned that stuck out to me was when he said, "Frameworks are not tools for organizing your code, they are tools for organizing your mind." This changed my mind about how I approach web tools and frameworks. I used to be intimidated by them becuase I had the mind set of I have to change what I want to do to fit to this framework, but it should be I know what I want to do and I can use the framework to organize it.

I was intruiged with his explanation of the performance of Svelte and how realistic it is to use in the real world. Especially when it comes to the embedded web, which he says is the new frontier. I would have to agree that there is nothing more important than the performance of an application. People are moving at such a fast pace and they expect and need the tools they use to keep up. 

Lastly, Harris discusses some of the other benefits to Svelte, including accessibility. I personally get a little upset when so many people neglect to design and develop for disabilites. I understand that it can be easy to forgot an alt tag, but that is a simple fix. About Svelte, Harris says, "... it will let you write markup that isn't accessible but it won't respect you for it." A great start towards accessibility inclusive applications.
