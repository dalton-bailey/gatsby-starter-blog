Todo App

<img src="todopic.png" alt="todoapp"/>

This is my todo app built in vanilla javascript. There are a few main features. 

1. Adding a new todo
2. Viewing the todos by all todos and the other categories
3. Completing and deleting the todos
4. Toggling the completed todos.

When a new todo is created it is added to the end of the list of todos. All todos can be completed by clicking the check box and deleted. The category buttons will sort and display the todos by their categories. And the Completed Todos button will show the completed todos below the active todos. 

I spent some time on Dribbble looking at todo app designs. There were some pretty cool ones out there that would have been fun to design something similar. I used some of the design aspects I found and went with a simple design. 

I'll be honest there were a number of challenges I faced developing this app. Local storage was a big one becuase I had no previous experience with it. It took some trial and error and I eventually had a co-worker help me refactor my code so implementing local storage was a lot simpler. 

In the future, probably with any applicaiton I build, I will start with a basic html layout and design and build the app based on that. I was hard for me to build feautre how I wanted something to work becuase I hadn't already decided. For example, 

Show a screenshot of your app.
Explain how it works
Why did you design it the way you did?
What challenges did you face in developing this application?
How did you solve them?
What would you do differently next time?
