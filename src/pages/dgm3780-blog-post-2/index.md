Research & Learning

When I am learning something new and researching on the web I usually Google a few key words related to my topic and look through the top hits. Sometimes I will go straight to MDN, CSS Tricks or Stack Overflow. I try to stay away from tutorials and anything older than 2016. 

As far as tips and tricks go, something I have started doing is saving everything to a folder in my browser. Anytime I find something that interests me I save it. I think it is also helped me to save all of my own work and keep it organized. I often want to go back when I can't remember exactly how to do something and need a refresher and it is awful when I can't find what I need.

From what I understand, "Tutorial Hell" is not being able to build something from your own knowledge becuase all you've done is watch and follow tutorials.  

I think my learning style has changed a bit over the last few years I've been developing. When I started, I liked watching and listening to someone code and explain what they were doing. Then I would go and try and replicate what they did. I think this is still true when I am learning something completely new and I am unfamiliar with it. Now that I feel like I have more of a grasp on things, JavaScript specifically, I like to use a tutorial and code as a start or reference and try and figure it out on my own.

For someone who is new to web development, I would tell them to just start building things. It is important to understand the basics, but if you aren't applying them and building real life applications you won't get anywhere.
