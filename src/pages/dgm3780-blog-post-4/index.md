TypeScript

TypeScript is a stongly typed programmnig language that is a superset of JavaScript. It is pretty much JavaScript with a few more features. 

When programming in JavaScript, you have to run your code to see if it is valid. When transpiled, TypeScript will generate compilation errors. This helps with debugging and overall is more effiencent. This makes it a great tool for developers.

Transpilers and compilers are similar in that they both convert code from one language to another language. However, a transpiler converts code from one language to another with a similar level of abstraction. Becuase TypeScript is a superset of Javascript it is transpiled.
