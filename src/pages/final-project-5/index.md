<h1>Workout Tracker</h1>

This week I felt like a got a lot done and got to a point where I feel very comfortable with where my app is at. It is working well and I just have a few more user stories to complete. I finally figured out how to edit and save each workout and now you can rank the workout (easy, medium, hard). I also finished the goals so you can now delete, edit and save them.

Next week I want to finish my ranking system so in the ranking section the workouts will appear by difficulty. I am also hoping to work on the design. Right now it is very, very simple. I just wanted something to be able to work with, but now that almost everything is done I want to make it look better.

My biggest roadblock this week was setting up the delete, edit and save for the goals. I had to refactor quite a bit of code, but I got it all working well.
