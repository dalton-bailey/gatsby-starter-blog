My name is Bailey Dalton. I enjoy spending time outside. I love to ski, run and mountain bike. And I recently got married.

I have a little JavaScript experience. Mostly just the few classes I've taken. I work as a designer for a small company in Orem that manages websites for mortgage companies and loan officers, so outside of school I haven't done a tone of JavaScript.

My favorite part of web development is seeing everything come together and I'm hoping to learn a lot, but mostly improve my JavaScript skills.
